Credit Card Fraud Detection

Description:-

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model will help financial institutions identify suspicious activities and minimize losses due to fraudulent transactions.

Introduction:-

Credit card fraud is a significant problem that affects both financial institutions and cardholders. Fraudulent transactions can result in financial losses and damage to the reputation of financial institutions. Therefore, detecting and preventing fraud is crucial for maintaining trust and security in the financial system.

Machine learning algorithms offer an effective approach to detecting fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data. In this project, we'll explore a dataset containing credit card transactions and develop a machine learning model to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine.

Dataset:-

The dataset used in this project is creditcard.csv, which contains anonymized features derived from credit card transactions. The dataset includes features such as transaction time, transaction amount, and anonymized transaction features (V1 to V28). The target variable is Class, indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).

Steps:-

Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, handle missing values, normalize the data, and address class imbalance issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and correlations between features.
Model Training: Train a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Techniques for Improving Results: Experiment with oversampling or undersampling techniques to address class imbalance and improve model performance.
Dependencies:-

Python (>=3.6)
pandas
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Conclusion:-

Credit card fraud detection is a challenging problem, but machine learning techniques can help identify suspicious transactions and mitigate risks for financial institutions and cardholders. By developing robust models and leveraging advanced techniques, we can enhance fraud detection capabilities and safeguard against fraudulent activities in the financial system.
